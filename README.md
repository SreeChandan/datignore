# Ignore "G" IT

This extension is nothing of so complex, it just allow you to exclude file\directory\extension from git (playing with gitignore) via __vscode UI__.

## WARNING

Actually the extension supports directory that start without "/", GITHUB .gitignore style.  
In next reviews I'll try to fix this.

## How to use

![Example](http://andrewdev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cattura.png)

How you can see, it is very simple to use.  Just select the file\folder from the tree and select what you want from the context menu.

## Features
